## Types of laptops

The general term for a laptop computer that strikes a balance between portability and functionality.    
These can vary greatly in overall size and specification â€“ processor speed, storage capacity, memory (RAM) and screen size.    
They range in price from low-cost budget models to high-performance productivity and gaming models.
2. Ultraportable  
Thin, light laptops designed for mobility are often described as ultraportable (also sometimes called a sub-notebook).  
Maintaining a super-slim profile means they have to cut out some features such as larger connection ports and/or reduce the number of connection ports. The smallest models weigh about a kilogram.
3. Ultrabook  
Ultrabook is a term coined by computer chipmaker Intel for a special class of ultraportable notebook (hence Ultrabook).  Ultrabooks must meet specific criteria for various things such as size/weight, battery life, type of chipset (including built-in security features).  
Among their strong points is strong security and anti-theft protection built in at the hardware level.
